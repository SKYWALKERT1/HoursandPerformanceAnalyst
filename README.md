# Hours and Performance Analysis

## Overview

This project explores the relationship between hours of work/study and performance outcomes. Utilizing linear regression, we aim to predict performance based on the number of hours invested. This analysis can provide insightful data for educators, students, and professionals alike, illustrating how time management impacts results.

## Features

- **Data Analysis:** Comprehensive exploration of the dataset consisting of hours and performance metrics.
- **Linear Regression Model:** Utilization of a linear regression model to understand and predict the relationship between hours of effort and performance.
- **Visualization:** Detailed visualizations including scatter plots and regression lines to showcase the data and model predictions.
